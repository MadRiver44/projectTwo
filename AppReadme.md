### Project Workflow

This project is a Create, Read, Update, and Delete application. I started with Balsamiq to understand visually what I wanted to achieve. From there, as I created the wireframes, I wrote detailed user stories to guide the developent process and further refine all the steps a user would need to execute the utilty of the app. The next tool was Trello. With this, the development activities were planed and executed in relative order. As processes were completed, the board tasks migrated from todo -> inProgress -> Done-ski!.

### Challanges

The data structure was an evolving process and involved learning how to access deeply nested objects, arrays, an individually specific items. This was a big win in understanding how to structure an application from a data access perspective. Also, using React exposed weaknesses in my understanding of certain parts, particulary planning components with what they may require with repect to state, and how to add seperate fucntionality to child components.

This app will be re-developed from the ground up to have a better user experience, utilize a third party api, and add much more functionality and styling
